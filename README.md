# hello

These are the obsidian tears game canisters. One canister (hello) is the game backend. The other canister (hello_assets) is the reactjs frontend for interacting with the game. 

We load the game using unity-webgl after authenticating with stoic or plug wallet. Right now only connecting with plug is shown, but we'd like to add a button for stoic as well. (using whatever npm library they have, most likely)

## Running the project

### Only Frontend

You can run just the react frontend by going to the project directory and running:

```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend and Backend

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hello/
```

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
